ADO.Net:
- SQL : It is a query language used to perform CRUD operation on database tables
- SQL Server : It is a collection of databases and also it known as RDBMS.
- SSMS : Sql Server Management Studio, it is an IDE tool.
- By using above we are able to build a backend application

Frontend App: It is used to interact the user and perform the task.
- Examples: Console, Windows, Web App, Mobile apps etc.
- Inorder to develop we use different technologies like Console, WPF, Winforms, ASP.Net WebForms, ASP.Net MVC etc.


Backend Apps: Those are used to store the information.
- Examples: RDBMS(SQL Server) etc.

Middleware Apps: It is used to provide the communication between the frontend and backend application.
- ADO.Net, ADO, ORM Tools (Dapper, Entity Framework) etc.
- ADO.Net is a technology, which is used to provide communicate with frontend and backend apps.
- ADO.Net is having lot of class libraries. 
- ADO.Net is not only used to communicate with Sql Server, but also we are able to communicate with different data sources like Sql Server, Oracle, My Sql, Sybase etc.
- Inorder to communicate ADO.Net is having different classes in different namespace and we call it as "Providers"
- Examples
	- SqlClient			->	Sql Server
		- System.Data.SqlClient
			- SqlConnection
			- SqlCommand
			- SqlDataReader
			- SqlDataAdapter
			- SqlCommandBuilder etc.
	- OracleClient			->	Oracle Server
		- System.Data.OracleClient
	- OLEDB Client		->	Any DB
	- ODBC Client			->	Any DB
	- BorlandClient 		->	Any DB

- To connect with SQL Server using ADO.Net and SqlClient provider we have two methods
	- Connection-Oriented Architecture
		- Method - 1 (INSERT, UPDATE and DELETE)	
		- Method - 2 (Read)
	- DisConnection-Oriencted Architecture

Connection String: 
	- Server
	- credentials - Username and password (If it is Sql Authentication) 
	- integrated security = true (If it is windows authentication)
	- database
To Execute the query using ADO.Net Connection oriented architecture, SqlCommand  class provides 3 methods
	- ExecuteNonQuery()
		- It is used to execute the action queries (insert, update and delete).
		- This function will return the number of rows that are affected.
		- Return type is "int".

	- ExecuteScalar()
		- It is used to execute non-action query with aggregate functions (select + aggregate fun).
		- This function is used to retrive a single value from the database table.
		- Return type is "object".

	- ExecuteReader()
		- It is used to retrive data from database (select) 
		- It retrive either a single value or row or column or table.
		- This function return type is "SqlDataReader".

Connection Oriented Architecture(Method-1): (Insert/Update/Delete)
Step-1: Estb the connection
Step-2: Prepare the query and pass 
Step-3: Open the connection
Step-4: Execute the query
Step-5: Close the connection.

Connection Oriented Architecture(Method-2): (Insert/Update/Delete/[Select])
Step-1: Estb the connection
Step-2: Prepare the query and pass 
Step-3: Open the connection
Step-4: Execute the query
Step-5: Read the data from the data source
Step-6: Close the connection
